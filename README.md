# Environment Variable Management System

This project demonstrates how to securely manage environment variables in a Node.js application using the `dotenv` package. The goal is to load environment-specific variables from a `.env` file and use them within your application, ensuring that sensitive data (like API keys and database credentials) is kept secure and separate from the codebase.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- npm (Node Package Manager) available in your environment.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project.
2. **Install dependencies** by running the following command in your project directory:

   ```bash
   npm install
